# Robotics-Aerial-Robotics
This repository contains my solutions, notes, and implementations for the course Robotics: Aerial Robotics. Topics covered include quadrotor dynamics, control, state estimation, trajectory planning, and practical assignments. The goal is to document learning progress and provide code for future reference.
